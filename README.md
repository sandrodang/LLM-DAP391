## Question-answer generation for Vietnamese subject Marxism-Leninism Philosophy.
This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Vietnamese Question Answer Generation (QAG) model specifically designed to generate review questions and exam questions in the Vietnamese subject Marxist-Lenininist Philosophy, promoting the application of AI in education in Vietnam. Culturally and linguistically appropriate learning tools play a very important role, so our work focuses on creating a QAG system that can understand the Vietnamese context and generate appropriate questions and answers. Through the creation of a new QA dataset dedicated entirely to the Vietnamese subject Marxist-Lenininist Philosophy and the training and fine tuning processes, we have use a small-scale pre-trained language model (PLM) but the performance of generating Vietnamese questions is equivalent to that of LLM models. Our findings show that smaller specialized models can indeed match the capabilities of larger models, providing a more resource-efficient alternative without compromising on quality or efficiency. This study contributes to the broader discourse on the extensibility and adaptability of PLM, providing valuable insights into how to develop specialized models for specific educational purposes. This study explores the application of language models in education, especially in resource-poor languages such as Vietnamese, which pose significant challenges to the effective implementation of educational technologies.
